**A web browser designed to make the internet more accessible for individuals with dyslexia.**

---

## The Problem

The modern web is a sea of text. For the 10-15% of the population with dyslexia, navigating this sea can be a daily struggle. Crowded text, distracting layouts, and difficult-to-read fonts can turn a simple browsing session into a frustrating and overwhelming experience.

## Our Solution

Dyslexim is a web browser built from the ground up with the needs of dyslexic users in mind. By providing a suite of tools to customize the reading experience, Dyslexim empowers users to transform any webpage into a comfortable and readable format.

Our approach is based on proven accessibility principles:

*   **Readable Fonts**: We provide a selection of dyslexia-friendly fonts, including OpenDyslexic, to reduce letter confusion and improve readability.
*   **Enhanced Spacing**: Increased line and letter spacing helps to de-clutter text and make it easier to follow.
*   **Focused Reading**: Our unique gaze-highlighting feature acts as a digital reading ruler, guiding the user's focus and preventing them from losing their place.
*   **Customization**: Users can customize the highlight color, font, and text alignment to suit their personal preferences.

## Features

*   **Gaze-Activated Highlighting**: A real-time highlight that follows the user's gaze (simulated with the mouse), keeping them focused on the text they are reading.
*   **Font Customization**: Choose from a variety of dyslexia-friendly fonts, including OpenDyslexic, Poppins, and Roboto.
*   **Highlight Customization**: Change the color and alignment of the highlight box to fit your needs.
*   **Onboarding Experience**: A simple, one-time setup to personalize your browsing experience from the start.
*   **Modern, Tabbed Interface**: A clean and intuitive browser interface that is easy to navigate.
